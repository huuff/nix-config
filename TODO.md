## Home
* Make something so aliases are shared between different shells

### emacs
* Maybe use a different style for counsel-projectile-ag? Searching text fuzzily might be too much
* I've stopped using Hydra in favour of which-key, is it really better? well, at least I don't have to write all my hydras

## NixOS
* Create a function to make nixosConfigurations, put something that all share in there (for example, allowUnfree is in every configuration)
* Separate virtualization into a module

## Flake
* Set a user for everything in each machine (audio, virtualization, wheel and home-manager)
* Maybe switch to DevOS? it looks fine
