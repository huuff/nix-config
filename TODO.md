## Home
* Make something so aliases are shared between different shells
* I'm not even using surf, maybe I should fix it since I want to use it in emacs
* Remove stuff I don't use from i3status. Also test if I need numbering because it's a chore. UPDATE: Pretty sure it's gonna need numbering since it's an attribute set and attribute set's properties are unordered, try something cute with a list and imap
* Hide userland threads by default in `htop`
* See if I can use `pipewire` with `pulseaudio` emulation instead of `pulseaudio` since I have audio problems. [Check this](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sound-only-works-while-pavucontrol-is-open/15280/2)

## vim
* Fix coc diagnostic colors since I can't see shit
* I have set move line with C^arrows, maybe set it to C+Shit+Arrows. I think that's what idea uses and would make it consistent
* I think I can't use `vim-surround` correctly anymore? Previously I was able to use `ci*` to edit inside markdown italics/bold, but now I can't

## tmux
* Put number of detached sessions in status bar.
* Scrolling in copy mode when text is selected extends the selection.
* Double clicking in vim selects as visual selection but immediately then selects as tmux. I'd probably only want the first one.

## thefuck
* A module to `rm -rf` git repos when I forget to add `-f`
* A module to make a `cat` into a `bat`
