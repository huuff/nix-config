## Home
* Make something so aliases are shared between different shells
* I'm not even using surf, maybe I should fix it since I want to use it in emacs
* Remove stuff I don't use from i3status. Also test if I need numbering because it's a chore. UPDATE: Pretty sure it's gonna need numbering since it's an attribute set and attribute set's properties are unordered, try something cute with a list and imap

## emacs
* Maybe use a different style for counsel-projectile-ag? Searching text fuzzily might be too much
* Some type of `nercommenter`. UPDATE: I actually have `evil-nc`, but it's not working... is it because of `evilleader`?

## vim
* Fix coc diagnostic colors since I can't see shit
* I have set move line with C^arrows, maybe set it to C+Shit+Arrows. I think that's what idea uses and would make it consistent

## NixOS
* Module for ssh-agent
* My prod_jdk script is not working.

## tmux
* Put number of detached sessions in status bar.
* Scrolling in copy mode when text is selected extends the selection.
* Double clicking in vim selects as visual selection but immediately then selects as tmux. I'd probably only want the first one.

## thefuck
* A module to `rm -rf` git repos when I forget to add `-f`
* A module to make a `cat` into a `bat`
