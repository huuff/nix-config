## Important
* Switch from xorg to wayland and from i3 to sway

## Home
* Make something so aliases are shared between different shells
* I'm not even using surf, maybe I should fix it since I want to use it in emacs
* Remove stuff I don't use from i3status. Also test if I need numbering because it's a chore. UPDATE: Pretty sure it's gonna need numbering since it's an attribute set and attribute set's properties are unordered, try something cute with a list and imap
* Hide userland threads by default in `htop`
* Add a keybinding to lock the screen with a command and i3lock 

## vim
* I have set move line with C^arrows, maybe set it to C+Shit+Arrows. I think that's what idea uses and would make it consistent
* I think I can't use `vim-surround` correctly anymore? Previously I was able to use `ci*` to edit inside markdown italics/bold, but now I can't
* Some plugin for grammar (grammarous is installed but not configured I think) both for english and spanish for `*.md` files and for `*.eml` (emails)

## tmux
* Put number of detached sessions in status bar.
* Scrolling in copy mode when text is selected extends the selection.
* Double clicking in vim selects as visual selection but immediately then selects as tmux. I'd probably only want the first one.

## thefuck
* A module to `rm -rf` git repos when I forget to add `-f`
* A module to make a `cat` into a `bat`
