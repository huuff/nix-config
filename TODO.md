## Home
* Make something so aliases are shared between different shells
* I'm not even using surf, maybe I should fix it since I want to use it in emacs
* Remove stuff I don't use from i3status

## emacs
* Maybe use a different style for counsel-projectile-ag? Searching text fuzzily might be too much
* I've stopped using Hydra in favour of which-key, is it really better? well, at least I don't have to write all my hydras

## vim
* Fix coc diagnostic colors since I can't see shit
* I have set move line with C^arrows, maybe set it to C+Shit+Arrows. I think that's what idea uses and would make it consistent

## Flake
* Maybe switch to DevOS? it looks fine
