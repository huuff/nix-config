## Home
* Make something so aliases are shared between different shells
* My derivations are loaded with fetchGit, do it using flakes
* Disable scrolling in st since now I use tmux for it

## emacs
* Maybe use a different style for counsel-projectile-ag? Searching text fuzzily might be too much
* I've stopped using Hydra in favour of which-key, is it really better? well, at least I don't have to write all my hydras

## vim
* Fix coc diagnostic colors since I can't see shit

## Flake
* Maybe switch to DevOS? it looks fine

## Other
* A module for java related stuff
