;; TABS CONFIG
;; I use centaur tabs but (TODO) I'd love to be able to achieve a similar config
;; using the built-in tab-line mode.
;; In the future, I hope to set up some config to chose between the two

;; TODO: Split workspaces by some useful criterion rather than just by project.
;; for example, excluding by treemacs workspaces would be great (but that would depend on treemacs)

;; TODO: Maybe make a hydra/transient for tabbing around
